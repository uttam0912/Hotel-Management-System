# Hotel-Management-System
Hotel room and guest management system using Object Oriented programming and MySQL in C++

- An easy to use system that can be used by anyone with minimal training.
- Functionalitites included:
  1. Adding and modifying rooms.
  2. Searching for available rooms.
  3. Guest Check In and Check Out.
  5. Searching for guest's data.
- The first iteration of the project stored data of customers and rooms using vector in C++. 
  But this model had a major issue that whenever we compile the program all the old data gets lost. 
- To improve the model, for the next iteration CSV file handling concepts are used to store data so that we are able to store data permanently.
- Using CSV files to store data also made the data more readable.
- Third iteration of the model involves MySQL integration which enables the data to be stored over cloud.
